## Project Overview
This project is a JavaFX-based desktop application that simulates how modern software systems
track API usage, apply rate-limiting rules, and detect abusive behavior.
The system works entirely in memory using Java objects and collections.
No real networking, servers, or APIs are involved.

## Key Features
- Register simulated API clients
- Record API request activity
- Apply rate-limiting policies
- Detect abnormal or abusive usage patterns
- Generate per-client usage and abuse reports

## Technologies Used
- Java 21+
- JavaFX
- Java Collections (List, Map)
- Java Time API (LocalDateTime, Duration)

## Core Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Interfaces and Polymorphism
- Strategy-like policy evaluation
- Enums for request types and violation levels
- Logical simulation of real-world systems

## Collaboration Method
This project is developed using **asynchronous collaboration**.
Each team member contributes independently based on availability,
following modern software development practices.

## Notes
This is a simulation project for academic purposes.
It does not include real networking, HTTP, REST APIs, or databases.
